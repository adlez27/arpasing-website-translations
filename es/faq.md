# Frequently Asked Questions

Q: What is ARPAsing?
A: ARPAsing is a systematic method for English-language vocals in UTAU.

Q: Why use ARPAsing?
A: With tools like Moresampler's automatic OTOing, and ARPAsing Assistant for converting words to phonemes in USTs, it's a very quick way to make English voicebanks and use them right away. This can be useful for creating prototypes.

Q: What language is ARPAsing made for?
A: ARPAsing is based on Arpabet and CMUDict, which were made for English. Therefore, ARPAsing is only made for English.

Q: Is ARPAsing available in other languages?
A: No. If it wasn't made for English, it wouldn't use Arpabet and it wouldn't be called ARPAsing.

Q: How do you pronounce "ARPAsing"?
A: It's made of the acronym "ARPA" and the English word "sing".
Arpabet: aa r p ax s ih ng
X-SAMPA: Ar\p@sIN
IPA: ɑɹpəsɪŋ

Q: If a reclist is based on words, does that make it ARPAsing?
A: No. ARPAsing reclists don't need to be based on words.

Q: If a voicebank is OTO'd so that each sample has only 2 phonemes, does that make it ARPAsing?
A: No. This style of OTOing can be used for many different kinds of voicebanks.

Q: How can you tell if a reclist or voicebank counts as ARPAsing?
A: It needs to be compatible with the official ARPAsing tools (Moresampler and ARPAsing Assistant), or otherwise use phonemes that are officially part of Arpabet.

Q: Can ARPAsing be used outside of UTAU?
A: ARPAsing's tools are made specifically for UTAU. However, it's very common to see Arpabet and CMUDict in other singing and speech software.

Q: What's the difference between ARPAsing and Arpabet?
A: Arpabet is a set of phonemes for describing English pronunciation. ARPAsing is a method of using UTAU that involves Arpabet phonemes.
